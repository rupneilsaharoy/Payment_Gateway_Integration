Payment Gateway Integration

This is a website created by me using html and css for the task given by The Sparks Foundation (June 2021)

There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page whereuser can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc.

Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.
